# MMTQueue

### Purpose:
This software is intended to run the MMT queue operations. For now, this specifically is for MMIRS, but that will eventually change to include Binospec.

Please contact Richard Cool for questions or concerns (rcool@mmto.org).

This code is **not** production level at this point.  Work is ongoing.

## Todos:
1. <s> Create functions for sunrise and sunset </s>
2. Create function to calculate to compute moon position and brightness at given time
3. Create Data Structure / Model for storing "DONE" observations
4. Create Data Structure / Model for observing parameters
5. Create function to check for time until transit
6. Create function that edits TAC weight for each target given observed status
7. Create visualization tools to see what's been scheduled on a given night
8. Create schedule output for observer
9. Create "poor weather" override mode


####Current progress:

I'll try and keep this updated, but no promises.  

Feb 9 -- Repo created.
